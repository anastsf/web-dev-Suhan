  <dt id="1">When HTML5 has become a standard? What were the main reasons for developing new standard?</dt>
  <dd>HTML5 became a standard in October 2014. The main reasons for developing a new standard were to improve the language with support for the latest multimedia, to standardize browser behavior, and to make it easier for developers to create web applications.</dd>
  
  <dt id="2">What is the difference between W3C HTML5 and WHATWG HTML Living Standard?</dt>
  <dd>The W3C HTML5 is a snapshot of the specification at a specific point in time, while the WHATWG HTML Living Standard is constantly updated with new features and improvements as they are developed.</dd>
  
  <dt id="3">What is the minimal HTML page code?</dt>
  <dd>&lt!DOCTYPE html&gt&lthtml&gt&lthead&gt&lt/head&gt&ltbody&gt&lt/body&gt&lt/html&gt</dd>
  
  <dt id="4">Comment on semantic and presentational markup. Why presentational markup is considered deprecated now?</dt>
  <dd>Semantic markup is focused on the meaning and structure of content, while presentational markup is focused on the appearance. Presentational markup is considered deprecated now because it can be achieved more effectively with CSS, and semantic markup is better for accessibility and search engine optimization.</dd>
  
  <dt id="5">How you can check browser support for a particular tag or attribute?</dt>
  <dd>You can check browser support for a particular tag or attribute on websites like caniuse.com or MDN Web Docs, which provide information on browser compatibility for various web technologies.</dd>
  
  <dt id="6">What are the audio and video formats officially supported by the HTML standard? What happens if you use other format?</dt>
  <dd>The audio formats officially supported by the HTML standard are MP3, AAC, and Ogg Vorbis. The video formats supported are MP4, WebM, and Ogg Theora. If you use another format, the browser may not be able to play the media.</dd>
